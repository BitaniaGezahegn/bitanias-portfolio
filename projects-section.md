## 💡 Suggested Project Slots

Here’s how to fill out the section even if you only have 2–3 solid projects:

| Project Idea         | Tech Stack          | How to Describe It                                        |
| -------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| LMS Platform         | PHP, MySQL          | Focus on student/teacher experience + backend integration |
| Portfolio Website    | HTML, CSS, JS       | Emphasize design, performance, smooth effects             |
| Discord Bot (if any) | Python, Discord API | Highlight automation, user commands, API usage            |

If needed, I can help you polish descriptions or come up with placeholder demo projects with strong narratives.
