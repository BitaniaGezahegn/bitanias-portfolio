# Summary of Optimizations

I've implemented a comprehensive set of optimizations to enhance the website's performance, especially on low-end devices. Here's a breakdown of the changes:

---

## 1. Low-End Device Detection

- Added a `performance.js` script to detect low-end devices using:
  - Device memory
  - CPU cores
  - Mobile detection
- Created a global `performanceSettings` object to track device capabilities.
- Applied CSS classes to disable heavy animations on low-end devices.

---

## 2. Animation Optimizations

- Reduced the number of particles in the hero section from **15 to 8**.
- Added `will-change` properties to enable hardware acceleration.
- Implemented **conditional animation loading** based on device capabilities.
- Supported the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query.
- Optimized animation keyframes for smoother performance.

---

## 3. JavaScript Performance Improvements

- Used **event delegation** instead of attaching multiple listeners.
- Added **throttling** to scroll events to lower CPU usage.
- Replaced some animations with `requestAnimationFrame` for better smoothness.
- Used **passive event listeners** for improved scroll performance.
- Optimized loops and reduced unnecessary DOM operations.
- Cached DOM queries and calculations wherever possible.

---

## 4. Image Optimizations

- Added `width` and `height` attributes to all images to prevent layout shifts.
- Enabled `loading="lazy"` on images for deferred loading.
- Optimized placeholder image generation for low-end devices.
- Reduced image quality on low-end devices to save bandwidth and speed up loading.

---

## 5. CSS Optimizations

- Provided fallbacks for animations on low-end devices.
- Simplified CSS transitions and animations.
- Applied `will-change` only where beneficial for performance.
- Used `@media (prefers-reduced-motion)` to respect user preferences.

---

## 6. Rendering Optimizations

- Reduced **repaints** and **layout shifts**.
- Optimized **glassmorphism** effects for performance.
- Simplified hover effects on low-end devices.
- Minimized the complexity of background visual effects.

---

## Conclusion

These optimizations significantly enhance performance on low-end devices while preserving aesthetics and functionality on high-end systems. The website now **adapts to the user's device capabilities**, ensuring a smooth and responsive experience across a wide range of hardware.
