## ✍️ **Full Text Content**

### 👤 Subtle Personal Tagline (top corner or under headline)

> *Crafted with care by Bitania Gezahegn*

*Small, understated. You’re present, but not self-promoting.*

---

### 🖋 Main Headline (emotional, big text)

> **Beautiful Websites. Meaningful Experiences.**

*This line sells a *feeling*, not a service. It’s bold, calm, and elegant.*

---

### 💬 Supporting Line (value-focused)

*Avoids buzzwords like “frontend dev” or “responsive design” — this speaks to *results*.*

---
